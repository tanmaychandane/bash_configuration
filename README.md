# bash_configuration
<br>
"bash_profile" contains configuration of my bash shell. You are free to use and modify it to your needs. To use this configuration, copy contents of "bash_profile" and paste in your home directory as ".bashrc" as shown in "instruction.png"
<br>
PS
<br>
I didn't entirely write this configuration. I stole it from various sources, and rearranged it to suit my needs.
